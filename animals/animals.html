      <figcaption>Green sea turtles are unique among sea turtles in that they are primarily herbivores, eating mostly seagrasses and algae. This diet is what gives their cartilage and fat a greenish color (not their shells), which is where their name comes from.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>The queen parrotfish secretes a mucus cocoon in which it sleeps at night. The cocoon acts to isolate the scent of the parrotfish, making it less vulnerable to predators.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Caribbean reef sharks, while large sharks, could actually be considered mesopredators rather than apex predators in isolated environments such as offshore atolls. Their diet is similar to other large bony fishes in the same ecosystem, including barracudas and groupers. </figcaption>

      <figcaption>Hammerheads will use their head to ram and pin down prey, tiring them out and making them easier to eat, a true demonstration of the hammer-action!</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Brittle stars have long, flexible arms that they use to crawl across the ocean floor. This species has a small central disc which is clearly separated from the five long thin arms.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Atlantic oval squid use rainbow displays of color to communicate with each other, and they can achieve very intense, shimmering hues. Though found at depths up to 18 meters (60 ft), they are also seen close to the surface at night, and seem to be attracted to light.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>The Leatherback Sea Turtle, also known as the lute turtle or the leathery turtle, is the largest sea turtle and the most migratory. It swims around the globe, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and travelling as far north as Alaska and Norway and as far south as the most southern point of New Zealand, South America and South Africa.</figcaption>
